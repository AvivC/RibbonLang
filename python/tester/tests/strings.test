test illegal to set attribute on string
    # this is a fragile test because we rely on the very specific error output, which is very likely to change.
    # this is why at the time of writing this, we usually don't have tests for specific error conditions (which isn't a great thing).
    # this case is an exception, and we might have to update this test if and when the error output changes.
