repeat test surface memory corruptions by validating consistent stdout output
    # By specifying "repeat" on the test, it will not run once, but hundreds of times.
    # Trying to help inconsistent undefined behavior etc surface.

test string concat does not overflow stack

test more than 255 constants is handled correctly
    # this code should create 306 constants in the same code object.
    # things should still work (because in the bytecode the index of a constant is represented using two bytes, not one)
    # this test might not be the best logically, but this is good enough for now.
